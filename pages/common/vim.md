# vim

> Vim (Vi IMproved), a command-line text editor, provides several modes for different kinds of text manipulation.
> Pressing `i` enters edit mode. `<Esc>` goes back to normal mode, which doesn't allow regular text insertion.
> More information: <https://www.vim.org>.

**Important:** If you accidentally open Vim and have never used it before, _do not_ press anything. Type `:q!` and press enter to quit.

- Open a file:

`vim {{path/to/file}}`

- View Vim's help manual:

`:help<Enter>`

- Save a file:

`:write<Enter>`

- Quit without saving:

`:quit!<Enter>` or `:q!<Enter>`

- Save and quit:

`:wq<Enter>`

- Open a file at a specified line number:

`vim +{{line_number}} {{path/to/file}}`

- Undo the last operation:

`u`

- Search for a pattern in the file (press `n`/`N` to go to next/previous match):

`/{{search_pattern}}<Enter>`

- Perform a regex substitution in the whole file:

`:%s/{{pattern}}/{{replacement}}/g<Enter>`
